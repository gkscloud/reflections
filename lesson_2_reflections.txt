What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you init a repository, it tells git to keep track of all the files in that directory from that point on.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It helps to keep track of uncommitted changes ?
it gives you a chance to undo something before you commit
it saves you the trouble of having to create a new commit when you have some files ready but not all
maybe you want to work on only a few files at a time, then pool them together for a big commit

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
you can add files that have changed as part of the logical change to the staging area. Then commit all of them together as part of the logical change. 
multiple files may have been modified. But only one commit is registered against that particular change.
