git add
git clone
git commit
git status 
git log
git checkout

git diff (for comparing working directory to staging area)
git diff <oldcommit1> <newcommit>
git diff --staged (for comparing staging area to repository)

git reset --hard (Careful!)

git checkout master (get the most current HEAD)

git branch
shows the current branch

git branch <branchnametocreate>
(does not set it to the active branch) use git checkout for that

git checkout -b <new branchname>
this is the equivalent of 2 commands:
git branch <newbranchname>

git show <commitid>
you have to use this when you don't know the parent of a commit when doing a diff
this is needed whenever branches are merged. Because the new commits from another branch overlap with the parent commits of the master branch.

git branch -d <branchname>
deletes the LABEL of a particular branch. you don't need the LABEL of an older branch after it has been merged to the master. All the commits of that branch are preserved and reachable through the master

git remote
checks if there are any remotes setup

git remote add <remotename> <remotelink>
sets up a remote repo called <remotename> which is stored at the <remotelink>

git remote -v

git push <remotetosendto> <nameoflocalbranchtopush>
git push origin master
git pull <remotetopullfrom> <branchtopullto>


git pull <origin> <branch> 
is the same as 
1. git fetch <origin>
2. git merge master origin/master

git fetch <origin>
will get the latest commits from the remote and create a separate commit in your local repo based on your local origin/master
you will have to merge that manually into your master


git status compares your master to local copy of origin/master
it does not compare with GitHub's master

 Remember, though, origin/master won't show commits that are present on your local master but not GitHub.

 git pull origin master affects the local master branch. But if local master branch is checked out, it will also affect working directory and staging area
 Your answer for git pull is close, but there's a subtle mistake. 
 Since you have the master branch checked out, updating that will also update your working directory and staging area.
