Using diff to identify the bugs in a file
This worked because when there was a typo in the new file
it showed up as being different from the original 
this made it appear as a new line in the new file and hence
it was easy to point out!

Having access to the entire history of a file can easily help track
the changes that have been made to the file. In case someone wants to revert
back to specific point in time to work with that version it becomes very 
easy to do so.

manually choosing when to commit
pros: flexibility, readability of commit log
smaller number of commits
cons: not enough commits, lose out on data that would have otherwise been available
if the commits were done automatically

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
it makes me more confident that I can easily revert my code back to the last stable version
